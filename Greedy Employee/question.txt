A restraunt has n tables arranged in a circular manner. The cleaner gets money based on the number of tables he cleans.
He can move in either direction to reach the next table from the current one. He spends p minutes to move from one table to another.
If all dishes have already been removed from a table, it takes him 1 minute to clean that table. If the dishes are still there then first he has to remove them which takes him another q minutes. He skips a table which he has already cleaned.
The employer has given him r minutes to clean as many tables as he can. Help him make the maximum amount of money.

Input Format:
The first input line contains 4 positive integers n, p, q, r - number of tables, time taken to move between tables, time taken to remove dishes from a table, total time available to clean the tables.
The second input line contains a string of length n made up to two alphabets d, a - dishes present on table, dishes not on table. The i-th alphabet in the string tells the status of dishes on the i-th table.

Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 x 10^5, 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9

Output Format:
The output consists of a single which contains an integer which is the maximum number of tables that the cleaner can clean in the given time.
